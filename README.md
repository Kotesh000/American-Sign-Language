# ASL Detection System

This project uses OpenCV, NumPy, and machine learning techniques to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) signs. The system captures images of hands making ASL signs and processes them to train a model for real-time detection.

## Repository Contents
- **Code**: Source code for data collection, image processing, model training, and real-time detection.
- **Data**: Dataset of ASL signs used for training the model.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Images of various ASL signs are captured.
- **Image Processing**: Preprocessing with techniques like thresholding and resizing.
- **Model Training**: A machine learning model (e.g., CNN) is trained to recognize ASL signs.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Recognizes ASL signs from webcam video input.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install libraries with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Capture images with a webcam or use the real-time detection script.
